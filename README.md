### Minidumper

Minidumper is a command-line tool that can capture dump files of .NET processes in three modes: **minimal**, which is enough just for basic triage; **heap**, which includes managed heap information and other data required to diagnose more intricate .NET issues; and **full**, which creates a complete dump file.

What makes Minidumper interesting is the **heap** mode. For large applications, especially with a lot of modules or when unmanaged memory and code are involved, dumps generated by the **heap** mode can be 5x or 10x smaller than full memory dumps, but will still allow complete investigation of many .NET issues by tools like Visual Studio and WinDbg (SOS).

### DumpWriter

Also included is a stand-alone library (DumpWriter) that can be added to any project to capture dumps of arbitrary processes. The DumpWriter project also contains the full interop signatures for the Win32 `MiniDumpWriteDump` API and all associated data structures, including callback input and output structures.

> ### NOTES
> * To create dumps of 32-bit processes, make sure to use the 32-bit version of the application -- and vice versa for 64-bit.
> * .NET 4.6 is currently not supported because of a limitation in CLRMD. You can work around this in the meantime by compiling your own version of CLRMD from [this pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnetsamples/pull/23/files).

### Usage

```
  --pid        The id of the process to dump.

  --pn         The name of the process to dump.

  -f           Required. The name of the dump file to create.

  --mini       Create a minimal dump file, enough to diagnose crashes and
               display call stacks.

  --heap       Create a dump file with the CLR heap, but without module code or
               unmanaged memory contents.

  --full       Create a complete dump file with the full memory address space.

  -v           Get detailed diagnostic output from the dump capturing process.

  --help       Display this help screen.

  --version    Display version information.
```
